## 🔒 TypeScript Config Highlights

- `"strict": true` – Enforces strict typing
- `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` – For modern bundlers like Vite
- `"jsx": "react-jsx"` – For the new JSX transform
- `"noUncheckedSideEffectImports": true` – Clean and safe code

---

## 📁 Declarations

You do not need `declarations.d.ts` unless importing untyped JS libraries. All your `.tsx` components are correctly typed by default.

---

## 🧼 Linting

Ensure ESLint is configured (`eslint.config.js`) to enforce best practices, such as:

- No unused variables
- Consistent component structure
- Dark mode-friendly styles (already applied)

---

## 📍 Location Embed

Google Maps iframe is embedded in the footer for contact location preview.
